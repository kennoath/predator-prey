# Predator Prey

This is a 2d grid predator prey simulation thing.

## Todos:
* Reduce draw calls
* Pass simulation parameters as args
* population readout
* steal more ideas from Primer
* abstract species maybe 
    * prey and predator might share most of their implementation and additional species could be easily tested
